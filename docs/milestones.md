# Development Milestones

This document defines the development milestones for the task manager project. Each milestone represents a single, cohesive concept that can be completed independently.

## Milestone Completion Criteria

Before a milestone can be considered complete, it must satisfy:

1. **Documentation**: Complete documentation covering the milestone's functionality
2. **Tests**: If the milestone includes code changes, comprehensive tests must be written
3. **Working Implementation**: The milestone's functionality must be implemented and working
4. **Versioning**: The milestone should create a new version:
   * **Milestones 1-5**: Can be minor version changes (`X.Y.0`) depending on the nature of changes
   * **Milestone 6 and later**: Milestone 6 (Recurring Tasks) introduces breaking changes and requires a major version (`X.0.0`). Later milestones will be evaluated individually.

Milestones should be completed in order, as later milestones may depend on earlier ones.

## Cross-Milestone Considerations

### Forgiveness Principle
- Be forgiving in file format parsing, CLI input, and data validation; preserve user intent and recover gracefully from malformed input or files.

### Testing
- Each milestone needs comprehensive tests (happy paths, edge cases, error cases, multi-host where relevant).
- Testing framework: Perl `Test::More` (existing suite); extend with supporting modules as needed. Git-integration strategy and coverage goals remain to be refined.

### Program Help
- Every CLI command/option must include `--help` with concise examples; consider a `task help` command for discovery.

### Documentation
- Complete docs before marking a milestone done; include usage, configuration, examples, edge cases, and limitations.

### Hooks Integration
- Identify hook events, required context, and examples for new functionality; pre-hooks may modify/abort, post-hooks may trigger side effects.

### Configuration Needs
- Follow the precedence hierarchy (CLI > env vars > data dir > global > defaults); document defaults and validation.

### Quality and UX
- Consistent error messages/logging, clear output formats, multi-host safety, backward-compatibility awareness, validation of inputs/config/data, and good user feedback.

### Performance Philosophy
- Optimize for human-scale use; prefer simplicity over premature optimization. Profile only when users report issues.

* Hook error handling and abort capability
* Hook configuration parsing and validation
* Support for hooks in both global and data directory configuration files

* Post-hooks can perform side effects (notifications, logging, etc.)
* Hook failures are logged with configurable abort behavior
* Data directory hooks take precedence over global hooks

## Future Milestones

The following milestones are planned but not yet fully defined. They should follow the same pattern: single concept, documentation, tests, working implementation.

### Projects

**Goal**: Add project/context support to tasks for organization.

**Scope**:
* Extend task file format to include project field (single string)
* Update `mytask add` command to accept project
* Update `mytask edit` command to modify project
* Update `mytask list` command to filter by project
* Document project format and usage

**Requirements**:
* Single project per task (not multiple)
* Project is a simple string identifier
* Filtering by project in list command
* Project can be empty/null

**Deliverables**:
* Updated task file format documentation
* Example task files with projects
* Updated CLI commands supporting projects
* Documentation in `docs/data-model.md`

**Tests**:
* Test project parsing and storage
* Test project filtering in list command
* Test project editing
* Test edge cases (empty project, special characters, etc.)

**Dependencies**: Milestone 1 (Task File Format), Milestone 2 (Basic Commands)

### Git Integration

**Goal**: Detect and interact with git repositories for sync.

**Design Considerations**:
* Locking strategies: advisory locking, rely on git conflicts, or file locking (e.g., `File::NFSLock`).
* Conflict resolution: field-wise merge vs last-writer-wins vs manual resolution via git tools.
* Recommended approach: advisory locking for same-machine edits; rely on git for multi-machine sync; hybrid conflict handling (timestamps tracked, status last-writer-wins with detection, descriptions/notes via merge markers, tags/dependencies union-merged).

**Dependencies**: Milestone 2 (Basic Commands), Milestone 3 (Configuration Handling)

### Export/Import

**Goal**: Implement export and import functionality for various formats.

**Dependencies**: Milestone 2 (Basic Commands)

### Conflict Handling

**Goal**: Detect and assist with merge conflicts in task files.

**Dependencies**: Milestone 2 (Basic Commands), Git Integration milestone

### Timestamp Format and Reliability

**Goal**: Evaluate moving from ISO 8601 to Unix epochs (or hybrid) for reliability, while preserving readability and validating manual edits.

### Notes Entry Sorting and Timestamp Handling

**Goal**: Keep `[[notes]]` entries chronologically ordered; handle identical timestamps, out-of-order edits, and large arrays efficiently.

### Invalid Filename and Format Recovery

**Goal**: Detect and repair non-UUID filenames and incomplete/invalid TOML; optionally auto-fix with backups, generate UUIDs, and preserve content.

### Show/Reminder Fields

**Goal**: Add deferred-visibility (`show`/`show_date`) and reminder fields (single or array) using human-friendly relative formats; define parsing, validation, and listing defaults.

### Additional UIs and Packaging

**Goal**: Explore Docker image, curses-based TUI, web UI, Android app, and PAR::Packer packaging.
