# Development Milestones

This document defines the development milestones for the task manager project. Each milestone represents a single, cohesive concept that can be completed independently.

## Milestone Completion Criteria

Before a milestone can be considered complete, it must satisfy:

1. **Documentation**: Complete documentation covering the milestone's functionality
2. **Tests**: If the milestone includes code changes, comprehensive tests must be written
3. **Working Implementation**: The milestone's functionality must be implemented and working
4. **Versioning**: The milestone should create a new version:
   * **Milestones 1-5**: Can be minor version changes (`X.Y.0`) depending on the nature of changes
   * **Milestone 6 and later**: Milestone 6 (Recurring Tasks) introduces breaking changes and requires a major version (`X.0.0`). Later milestones will be evaluated individually.

Milestones should be completed in order, as later milestones may depend on earlier ones.

## Milestone 1: Task File Format (Basic)

**Goal**: Define and document the basic task file format (TOML structure) with examples for core scenarios.

**Scope**:
* Define the TOML structure for task files
* Document core fields and their purposes:
  * ID (unique identifier)
  * Description
  * Status (pending, done, deleted)
  * Created/modified timestamps
  * Due date / scheduled date
* Create example task files for basic scenarios:
  * Simple task (basic fields only)
  * Task with notes/body text
  * Task with due date
  * Completed task
  * Deleted task
* Validate that examples are parseable TOML
* Document field validation rules for core fields

**Deliverables**:
