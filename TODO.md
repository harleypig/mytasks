# TODO

Track milestone progress. All milestone details, open questions, and decisions live in `docs/milestones.md`.

* When adding a new task, determine if it fits in the current or any future milestone and add it to the appropriate section in `docs/milestones.md`, otherwise add it below.

## Milestones

- [x] Milestone 1: Task File Format (Basic) — complete

- [ ] Additional UIs (TUI/Web/Android) and packaging (Docker, PAR::Packer)

## Perlcritic Follow-ups

- [ ] Refactor `t/02-examples.t` to lower main complexity and remove the `Modules::ProhibitExcessMainComplexity` suppression once the helper structure is in place.
- [ ] Evaluate feasibility of severity 1 for perlcritic; list blockers if not practical.

## Commitizen Configuration Follow-ups

- [ ] Decide on changelog handling and add `changelog_file` if/when `cz bump` is used (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md`).
- [ ] Enforce concise titles by setting `message_length_limit` (suggested: 72).
- [ ] Decide whether to explicitly allow autosquash prefixes; add `allowed_prefixes` for `fixup!` / `squash!` if desired.
- [ ] Confirm whether to keep `update_changelog_on_bump: true` now or defer until the release workflow is defined.
- [ ] Align tagging style: if tags should be prefixed (e.g., `v1.2.3`), set `tag_format: v$version`; otherwise keep `$version`.

## Perl Tools

Use [tidyall](https://metacpan.org/dist/Code-TidyAll/view/bin/tidyall) for the various linters, validators and such.

## GitHub Actions Follow-ups

- [ ] Revisit workflow structure: keep reusable job workflows (pre-commit and future checks) and ensure the self-review gate depends on all required jobs; consider caching and runner image strategy to reduce install time.
